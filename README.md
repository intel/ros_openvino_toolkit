# Introduction
The [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) toolkit quickly deploys applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the Toolkit extends computer vision (CV) workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance.

This project is a ROS wrapper for CV API of [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit), providing the following features:
* Support CPU and GPU platforms
* Support standard USB camera and Intel® RealSense™ camera
* Face detection
* Emotion recognition
* Age and gender recognition
* Head pose recognition
* Demo application to show above detection and recognitions

**Note**:  
Only OpenVINO <b>R3</b> release is supported currently. See more from [Release Notes](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-RelNotes).  

**Note**:  
Two methods are provided to install the OpenVINO™ toolkit:
